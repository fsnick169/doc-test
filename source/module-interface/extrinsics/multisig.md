 approveAsMulti(threshold: `u16`, other_signatories: `Vec<AccountId32>`, maybe_timepoint: `Option<PalletMultisigTimepoint>`, call_hash: `[u8;32]`, max_weight: `SpWeightsWeightV2Weight`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.multisig.approveAsMulti`
- **summary**:    Register approval for a dispatch to be made from a deterministic composite account if  approved by a total of `threshold - 1` of `other_signatories`. 

   Payment: `DepositBase` will be reserved if this is the first approval, plus  `threshold` times `DepositFactor`. It is returned once this dispatch happens or  is cancelled. 

   The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_. 

   - `threshold`: The total number of approvals for this dispatch before it is executed. 

  - `other_signatories`: The accounts (other than the sender) who can approve this dispatch. May not be empty. 

  - `maybe_timepoint`: If this is the first approval, then this must be `None`. If it is not the first approval, then it must be `Some`, with the timepoint (block number and  transaction index) of the first approval transaction. 

  - `call_hash`: The hash of the call to be executed.

   NOTE: If this is the final approval, you will want to use `as_multi` instead. 

  - Complexity:    O(1).

  - Up to one balance-reserve or unreserve operation.

  - One passthrough operation, one insert, both `O(S)` where `S` is the number of signatories. `S` is capped by `MaxSignatories`, with weight being proportional. 

  - One encode & hash, both of complexity `O(S)`.

  - Up to one binary search and insert (`O(logS + S)`).

  - I/O: 1 read `O(S)`, up to 1 mutate `O(S)`. Up to one remove.

  - One event.

  - Storage: inserts one item, value size bounded by `MaxSignatories`, with a deposit taken for its lifetime of `DepositBase + threshold * DepositFactor`. 
 
 asMulti(threshold: `u16`, other_signatories: `Vec<AccountId32>`, maybe_timepoint: `Option<PalletMultisigTimepoint>`, call: `Call`, max_weight: `SpWeightsWeightV2Weight`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.multisig.asMulti`
- **summary**:    Register approval for a dispatch to be made from a deterministic composite account if  approved by a total of `threshold - 1` of `other_signatories`. 

   If there are enough, then dispatch the call. 

   Payment: `DepositBase` will be reserved if this is the first approval, plus  `threshold` times `DepositFactor`. It is returned once this dispatch happens or  is cancelled. 

   The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_. 

   - `threshold`: The total number of approvals for this dispatch before it is executed. 

  - `other_signatories`: The accounts (other than the sender) who can approve this dispatch. May not be empty. 

  - `maybe_timepoint`: If this is the first approval, then this must be `None`. If it is not the first approval, then it must be `Some`, with the timepoint (block number and  transaction index) of the first approval transaction. 

  - `call`: The call to be executed.

   NOTE: Unless this is the final approval, you will generally want to use  `approve_as_multi` instead, since it only requires a hash of the call. 

   Result is equivalent to the dispatched result if `threshold` is exactly `1`. Otherwise  on success, result is `Ok` and the result from the interior call, if it was executed,  may be found in the deposited `MultisigExecuted` event. 

  - Complexity:    `O(S + Z + Call)`.

  - Up to one balance-reserve or unreserve operation.

  - One passthrough operation, one insert, both `O(S)` where `S` is the number of signatories. `S` is capped by `MaxSignatories`, with weight being proportional. 

  - One call encode & hash, both of complexity `O(Z)` where `Z` is tx-len.

  - One encode & hash, both of complexity `O(S)`.

  - Up to one binary search and insert (`O(logS + S)`).

  - I/O: 1 read `O(S)`, up to 1 mutate `O(S)`. Up to one remove.

  - One event.

  - The weight of the `call`.

  - Storage: inserts one item, value size bounded by `MaxSignatories`, with a deposit taken for its lifetime of `DepositBase + threshold * DepositFactor`. 
 
 asMultiThreshold1(other_signatories: `Vec<AccountId32>`, call: `Call`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.multisig.asMultiThreshold1`
- **summary**:    Immediately dispatch a multi-signature call using a single approval from the caller. 

   The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_. 

   - `other_signatories`: The accounts (other than the sender) who are part of the  multi-signature, but do not participate in the approval process. 

  - `call`: The call to be executed.

   Result is equivalent to the dispatched result. 

  - Complexity:    `O(Z + C)` where Z is the length of the call and C its execution weight. 
 
 cancelAsMulti(threshold: `u16`, other_signatories: `Vec<AccountId32>`, timepoint: `PalletMultisigTimepoint`, call_hash: `[u8;32]`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.multisig.cancelAsMulti`
- **summary**:    Cancel a pre-existing, on-going multisig transaction. Any deposit reserved previously  for this operation will be unreserved on success. 

   The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_. 

   - `threshold`: The total number of approvals for this dispatch before it is executed. 

  - `other_signatories`: The accounts (other than the sender) who can approve this dispatch. May not be empty. 

  - `timepoint`: The timepoint (block number and transaction index) of the first approval transaction for this dispatch. 

  - `call_hash`: The hash of the call to be executed.

  - Complexity:    `O(S)`.

  - Up to one balance-reserve or unreserve operation.

  - One passthrough operation, one insert, both `O(S)` where `S` is the number of signatories. `S` is capped by `MaxSignatories`, with weight being proportional. 

  - One encode & hash, both of complexity `O(S)`.

  - One event.

  - I/O: 1 read `O(S)`, one remove.

  - Storage: removes one item.
 
 pokeDeposit(threshold: `u16`, other_signatories: `Vec<AccountId32>`, call_hash: `[u8;32]`)
- **interface**: `api.tx.multisig.pokeDeposit`
- **summary**:    Poke the deposit reserved for an existing multisig operation. 

   The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_ and must be the original depositor of  the multisig operation. 

   The transaction fee is waived if the deposit amount has changed. 

   - `threshold`: The total number of approvals needed for this multisig. 

  - `other_signatories`: The accounts (other than the sender) who are part of the multisig. 

  - `call_hash`: The hash of the call this deposit is reserved for.

   Emits `DepositPoked` if successful.
