## electionProviderMultiPhase
 
 governanceFallback(maybe_max_voters: `Option<u32>`, maybe_max_targets: `Option<u32>`)
- **interface**: `electionProviderMultiPhase.governanceFallback`
- **summary**:    Trigger the governance fallback. 

   This can only be called when [`Phase::Emergency`] is enabled, as an alternative to  calling [`Call::set_emergency_election_result`]. 
 
 setEmergencyElectionResult(supports: `Vec<(AccountId32,SpNposElectionsSupport)>`)
- **interface**: `electionProviderMultiPhase.setEmergencyElectionResult`
- **summary**:    Set a solution in the queue, to be handed out to the client of this pallet in the next  call to `ElectionProvider::elect`. 

   This can only be set by `T::ForceOrigin`, and only when the phase is `Emergency`. 

   The solution is not checked for any feasibility and is assumed to be trustworthy, as any  feasibility check itself can in principle cause the election process to fail (due to  memory/weight constrains). 
 
 setMinimumUntrustedScore(maybe_next_score: `Option<SpNposElectionsElectionScore>`)
- **interface**: `electionProviderMultiPhase.setMinimumUntrustedScore`
- **summary**:    Set a new value for `MinimumUntrustedScore`. 

   Dispatch origin must be aligned with `T::ForceOrigin`. 

   This check can be turned off by setting the value to `None`. 
 
 submit(raw_solution: `PalletElectionProviderMultiPhaseRawSolution`)
- **interface**: `electionProviderMultiPhase.submit`
- **summary**:    Submit a solution for the signed phase. 

   The dispatch origin fo this call must be __signed__. 

   The solution is potentially queued, based on the claimed score and processed at the end  of the signed phase. 

   A deposit is reserved and recorded for the solution. Based on the outcome, the solution  might be rewarded, slashed, or get all or a part of the deposit back. 
 
 submitUnsigned(raw_solution: `PalletElectionProviderMultiPhaseRawSolution`, witness: `PalletElectionProviderMultiPhaseSolutionOrSnapshotSize`)
- **interface**: `electionProviderMultiPhase.submitUnsigned`
- **summary**:    Submit a solution for the unsigned phase. 

   The dispatch origin fo this call must be __none__. 

   This submission is checked on the fly. Moreover, this unsigned solution is only  validated when submitted to the pool from the **local** node. Effectively, this means  that only active validators can submit this transaction when authoring a block (similar  to an inherent). 

   To prevent any incorrect solution (and thus wasted time/weight), this transaction will  panic if the solution submitted by the validator is invalid in any way, effectively  putting their authoring reward at risk. 

   No deposit or reward is associated with this submission.
