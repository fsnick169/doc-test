 addProxy(delegate: `MultiAddress`, proxy_type: `KitchensinkRuntimeProxyType`, delay: `u32`)
- **interface**: `proxy.addProxy`
- **summary**:    Register a proxy account for the sender that is able to make calls on its behalf. 

   The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_. 

   Parameters: 

  - `proxy`: The account that the `caller` would like to make a proxy.

  - `proxy_type`: The permissions allowed for this proxy account.

  - `delay`: The announcement period required of the initial proxy. Will generally be zero. 
 
 announce(real: `MultiAddress`, call_hash: `H256`)
- **interface**: `proxy.announce`
- **summary**:    Publish the hash of a proxy-call that will be made in the future. 

   This must be called some number of blocks before the corresponding `proxy` is attempted  if the delay associated with the proxy relationship is greater than zero. 

   No more than `MaxPending` announcements may be made at any one time. 

   This will take a deposit of `AnnouncementDepositFactor` as well as  `AnnouncementDepositBase` if there are no other pending announcements. 

   The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_ and a proxy of `real`. 

   Parameters: 

  - `real`: The account that the proxy will make a call on behalf of.

  - `call_hash`: The hash of the call to be made by the `real` account.
 
 createPure(proxy_type: `KitchensinkRuntimeProxyType`, delay: `u32`, index: `u16`)
- **interface**: `proxy.createPure`
- **summary**:    Spawn a fresh new account that is guaranteed to be otherwise inaccessible, and  initialize it with a proxy of `proxy_type` for `origin` sender. 

   Requires a `Signed` origin. 

   - `proxy_type`: The type of the proxy that the sender will be registered as over the  new account. This will almost always be the most permissive `ProxyType` possible to  allow for maximum flexibility. 

  - `index`: A disambiguation index, in case this is called multiple times in the same transaction (e.g. with `utility::batch`). Unless you're using `batch` you probably just  want to use `0`. 

  - `delay`: The announcement period required of the initial proxy. Will generally be zero. 

   Fails with `Duplicate` if this has already been called in this transaction, from the  same sender, with the same parameters. 

   Fails if there are insufficient funds to pay for deposit. 
 
 killPure(spawner: `MultiAddress`, proxy_type: `KitchensinkRuntimeProxyType`, index: `u16`, height: `Compact<u32>`, ext_index: `Compact<u32>`)
- **interface**: `proxy.killPure`
- **summary**:    Removes a previously spawned pure proxy. 

   WARNING: **All access to this account will be lost.** Any funds held in it will be  inaccessible. 

   Requires a `Signed` origin, and the sender account must have been created by a call to  `pure` with corresponding parameters. 

   - `spawner`: The account that originally called `pure` to create this account. 

  - `index`: The disambiguation index originally passed to `pure`. Probably `0`.

  - `proxy_type`: The proxy type originally passed to `pure`.

  - `height`: The height of the chain when the call to `pure` was processed.

  - `ext_index`: The extrinsic index in which the call to `pure` was processed.

   Fails with `NoPermission` in case the caller is not a previously created pure  account whose `pure` call has corresponding parameters. 
 
 pokeDeposit()
- **interface**: `proxy.pokeDeposit`
- **summary**:    Poke / Adjust deposits made for proxies and announcements based on current values.  This can be used by accounts to possibly lower their locked amount.
