## timestamp
 
 minimumPeriod: `u64`
- **interface**: `timestamp.minimumPeriod`
- **summary**:    The minimum period between blocks. 

   Be aware that this is different to the *expected* period that the block production  apparatus provides. Your chosen consensus system will generally work with this to  determine a sensible block time.
