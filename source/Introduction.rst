PORTALDOT is a new generation of decentralized Layer0-level public chain, which aims to build a high-performance global blockchain application network service system for physical industries and become the core infrastructure of Web3.0 green and trusted digital civilization.

Vision: Build a green and reliable autonomous digital civilization
------------------
The long-term vision of PORTALDOT is to build a super ecology of "blockchain +" and open the "era of great navigation" for blockchain thinking, blockchain entities and financial all-round empowerment industries. It aims to establish a new type of production relations as a DAO and develop an industrial cooperative economic community.
PORTALDOT allows for the secure transmission of any type of data between any type of blockchain protocols, unlocking a vast array of real-world application scenarios. By combining the best features from multiple specialized blockchains, PORTALDOT paves the way for a new decentralized market and provides more equitable service support for a wide range of decentralized applications.

Technical architecture: dynamic heterogeneous fragmentation and 10,000-level TPS
------------------
The underlying architecture of PORTALDOT is based on the DHSA. Like a sophisticated neural network, it intelligently adjusts the computing power of 256 shards through AI-driven resource scheduling algorithms in a rapidly changing environment.
This design overcomes the limitations of traditional fragmented blockchain technology, making 10,000-level TPS and sub-second-level confirmations a reality. It also paves a new path for mapping physical assets to blockchains.
Under the framework of the RWA standardized platform, traditional assets such as real estate, commodities, and intellectual property can be seamlessly converted into programmable digital credentials. Its trusted on-chain ownership mechanism is reshaping the fundamental rules for global value circulation.
